# Help to improve Appwrite's {{name}} language translation ✍️

---

# Introduction

Did you know Appwrite's Locale API has support for returning responses in your own locale based on the value of the `X-Appwrite-Locale` header? 😮 We already support 56 languages and need your help to improve them! 💪

Your task is to update Appwrite's **{{name}}** language translations. We recently added new features, so some translations might be missing. You can find a complete in-depth tutorial in our official [tutorial for adding translations](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/docs/tutorials/add-translations.md).

This is what missing translation look like:

```json
"emails.magicSession.footer": "",
```

### Tasks summary:

- [ ] Fork & clone Appwrite
- [ ] Update translations for {{name}} in `app/config/locale/translations/{{code}}.json`
- [ ] Test the translations
- [ ] Push changes and submit pull request
