# Help Translate Appwrite to {{name}} language ✍️

---

# Introduction

Did you know Appwrite's Locale API has support for returning responses in your own locale based on the value of the `X-Appwrite-Locale` header? 😮 We already support 56 languages and need your help to push it even further! 💪

Your task is to translate Appwrite into **{{name}}** language. You can find a complete in-depth tutorial in our official [tutorial for adding translations](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/docs/tutorials/add-translations.md).

### Tasks summary:

- [ ] Fork & clone Appwrite
- [ ] Generate translations for {{name}} in `app/config/locale/translations/{{code}}.json`
- [ ] Add language as supported into `app/config/locale/codes.php`, if not already presented
- [ ] Add language as supported into `app/init.php`, if not already presented
- [ ] Test the translations
- [ ] Push changes and submit pull request
