# Upgrade Appwrite's documentation issue template to Github Forms ✍️

---

# Introduction

Did you know GitHub improved their issue templated by releasing beta version of Github issue forms? 👀

Your task is to rewrite current Appwrite's documentation issue template from markdown file to YAML to support Github forms. You can find a complete in-depth tutorial in [GitHub issue template Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms). To learn more about the syntax, check out [GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).

### Tasks summary:

- [ ] Fork & clone Appwrite
- [ ] Prepate Github issue form in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yaml`
- [ ] Test the issue on your fork
- [ ] Push changes and submit pull request

### Tips & Tricks:

- You need to stay on `master` branch after forking Appwrite for issue templates to work properly.
- To enable issues on the fork, visit `Settings` -> `Options` and allow `Issues`.
- If you are stuck, take a look at our already existing GitHub issue form for [Bug report](...)
